## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
In order to the clean the data we from the CSV file and the Mushroom_df I made sure there were no NaN values in any of the rows or columns. The columns were all in lowercase so I changed all of them to uppercase so that it looks neater and changed the "class" column to "Edible or Poisonous". I did some research on which features are the most important when it comes to telling if mushroom is edible or poisonous.The features that were not important were dropped. One of the features that were important was the size,color,and surface of the cap while another feature was the size and color of the gill. These and the other important features were kept in the new dataframe. I then checked for any null values in the new dataframe and found there were NaN values in "Stalk-Root" column and those rows were dropped. Once those rows were dropped I verified that there were no more null values in the dataframe.
