#Italian-Restaurant-Project
## Selected Topic
Our selected topic is to determine where will be the best area between East and West of 5th ave to open up a Italian restaurant based on the price and the Zagat rating of each restaurant. The Zagat rating is split into three different categories which are food, decor and service. Afterwards we want to determine the best location for our restaurant.
## Reason for Topic
We choose this topic because we are all interested in food and wanted to do Italian since it is one of the most famous and popular food item in NY. Also since there are numerous Italian places in NY we wanted to see if it would be better to open up a place either on the East or West of 5th ave. We chose 5th ave since it goes straight through Manhattan from North to South.
## Source for Data
The source of data we will use is a dataset containing about 168 Italian places in NYC. Each of them columns that give the name, price of food for 2, Zagat ratings for three different categories, longitude and latitude, and if they location is East or West of 5th ave. 
## Questions We Hope to Answer
The first question we hope to answer is if the Zagat rating for each category has any correlation with the price on the menu. If it does, then we can adjust our price based on whatever Zagat rating we receive. If the rating goes either up or down we could adjust our prices accordingly
The second question is to determine if the best place to open a restaurant would be East or West of 5th ave since it cuts straight through the middle of Manhattan. We want a general idea of which side would be better and figure of which side has more restaurants.
